## Description:
The fourth project of The Odin Project. An interactive "Etch-a-Sketch" which allows you to paint on a grid of squares by moving your mouse around. You can edit the color, chose a random color, erase colors, have each square be a new random color, play around with the transparency and more!

## Skills:
This project was a very useful way of practicing manipulating the DOM and using a variety of different events within JavaScript. It was an introduction to basic user input validation and user feedback. Finally, it further strengthened my HTML and CSS skills along.

## Reflection:
This project was more difficult than the previous projects, but it was also the project that I had the most fun with and spent the most time on. I added some of the extra features and some user feedback through the buttons. I spent a lot more time making a better design and I think that it paid off. This was the most fun project yet and I can't wait to see what I learn next.
